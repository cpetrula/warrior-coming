# Alternative Database Configuration (No Connection Pooling)

If the connection pool fix doesn't resolve the `ER_TOO_MANY_USER_CONNECTIONS` error, you can use individual database connections instead of pooling.

## How to Switch to No-Pool Mode

1. **Backup current database.js**:
   ```bash
   cd backend/config
   cp database.js database-pool.js
   ```

2. **Replace with no-pool version**:
   ```bash
   cp database-no-pool.js database.js
   ```

3. **Restart the server**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```

## What This Changes

- **No Connection Pooling**: Each database operation creates a new connection and closes it immediately
- **Eliminates Pool Limits**: No risk of hitting connection pool limits
- **Same API**: The interface remains identical - all existing code continues to work
- **Slightly Higher Overhead**: Each query has connection overhead, but eliminates pooling issues

## When to Use This

Use this approach if:
- You continue to get `ER_TOO_MANY_USER_CONNECTIONS` errors despite fixing the pool limit
- Your MySQL server has very restrictive user connection limits
- You have intermittent connection issues that pooling doesn't resolve

## Performance Considerations

- **Lower Throughput**: Each query requires establishing a new connection
- **Higher Latency**: Connection establishment adds overhead to each query
- **Better for Low-Traffic Sites**: Suitable for applications with low to moderate database activity
- **More Reliable**: Eliminates connection pool management issues

## To Revert Back to Pooling

Simply restore the original file:
```bash
cd backend/config
cp database-pool.js database.js
```
